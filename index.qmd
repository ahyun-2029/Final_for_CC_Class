# Why Scientific Computing?

###### With the rise of AI being incorporated in many aspects of our society, we see more and more things being run by computer programs rather than people themselves. This switch to scientific computing to run analysis of huge amounts of data was due to the fact that rather than making people go through every piece of data, which is both time consuming and can invite error, having a trained computer program analyze and predict millions of data in a matter of seconds can push forward many advancements in the science fields. I developed a very simple model that represented a concept I learned in chemistry through code to prove the benefits of scientific computing. There are many benefits to scientific computing but through my code, I focused on how scientific computing is beneficial due to speed of calculation, easy manipulation of dataframes, and how it automatically visualizes data for the user. 

# Chemistry Concept: Effective Nuclear Charge

###### While opposite charges attract, same charges repel each other. The electrons in an atom can cause repulsion between each other; the outer shell electrons are repeled by the electrons in the inner shell. This concept is called *shielding*; the repulsion reduces the proton-electron attraction, reducing the overall attractive force the protons in the atom have on the electrons. **Effective Nuclear Charge** is the amount of nuclear charge (proton charge) is felt by each individual electron. The higher the effective nulear charge, the stronger the attractive force the protons have on the electrons and the more tightly the electrons are wounded around the atom's nucleus. By knowing the effective nuclear charge, we are able to compare the relative sizes of elements as the more electrons are tightly wounded around the nucleus, the smaller the atomic size. We are also able to determine which elements are more likely to lose electrons in a chemical reaction as atoms that are bigger in size have less attractive force pulling the electrons in its nucleus making it easier for other atoms to pull outer electrons towards itself. Another benefit of knowing the effective nucler charge of an atom is that through the **Allred-Rochow's** formula for calculating *electronegativity*, a number that measures the tendency of an atom to attract the shared electrons in a bond, we can predict the type of molecular bond that atoms that are bonded together make. Atoms that are bonded together can make three types of bonds. A **pure covalent** bond is when electrons between the atoms are shared equally. A compound that have pure covalent bonds are non-polar molecules, the overall charge of the molecule is zero. A **polar covalent** bond is when the electrons between the atoms are shared unequally. This means the electrons shared are more frequently in one atom over the other. The atom that is more electronegative is typically the atom that attracts the electron more frequently and is partially negative while the other atom is partially positive. A compound that have polar covalent bonds are polar molecules, they have partially negative and partially positive charges in the molecule. Lastly, an **ionic** bond is when there is a complete transfer of electron from one atom to another, making the atom that lost its electron a positively charged atom (*cation*), and the atom that gained an electron a negatively charged atom (*anion*) If the difference in electronegativity between the two bonded atoms is less than 0.4, the compound is non-polar and the bond is a pure covalent. If the difference is between 0.4 and 1.8, the compound is polar and the bond a polar covalent. If the difference is greater than 1.8, the compound is now considered ionic and the bond an ionic bond.

###### My code calculates the effective nuclear charge of the first 3 rows of the elements on the periodic table and compares the relative effective nuclear charges by visualizing it on a bar graph. And using the calculated effective nuclear charge, I created a function based on the Allred-Rochow's electronegativity formula that by calling a specific element of the first 3 rows on the periodic table, is able to calculate the electronegativity of that said element.


# Benefit 1: Speed of Calculation 

###### The first thing before writing any type of code is to import all the packages needed to be able to do what you want to do through code: 

```{python}
import pandas as pd 
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
import os 
import sympy
```
###### The package pandas is needed so that you can create and manipulate dataframes. The package matplotlib.pyplot is needed to be able to visual the data into a graph. Os is imported so that python can be run from the terminal. Lastly, the package sympy is needed to create mathematical equation where variables can act as '*symbols*' that can be manipulated to do simple algebraic mathematics.
